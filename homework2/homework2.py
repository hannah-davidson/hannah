# Questions (Answer these in the homework2.py file as comments):

# 1) What’s the difference between Git, GitHub, and Git Bash?
# Git is a version control system that allows for tracking of changes in the codebase. Git Bash allows people to use Git commands using shell commands. Git Hub is a centralized, online platform for hosting Git repositories.
# 2) What’s the difference between the terminal and the command line?
# A terminal is a text input and output environment and allows you to run a shell. A command line is a type of interface that is used to enter commands, whereas a terminal allows us to enter commands.
# 3) How does Windows PowerShell differ from Git Bash?
# Git Bash is used on Linux/Unix machines, while PowerShell is run on Microsoft devices. Git Bash uses plain text, while PowerShell uses objects. 
# 4) What’s the difference between Anaconda, conda, and Python?
# Python is a computer programming language - it is the language that the computer "speaks." Anaconda is a bundle of software containing a Python interpreter and the standard Python library. It comes with several packages that can work together. conda is a package and environment manager that comes with Anaconda; it can be used to manage Python packages and build environments with different packages contained in them.
# 5) What is VS Code? 
# VS Code is a software that is used for other software development.
# 6) What is a Jupyter Notebook? How is it different from Jupyter Lab?
# Jupyter Notebook is a web-based computational environment. It is interactive and often used for data analysis and visualization. JupyterLab is a more interactive interface that includes more features than the limited amount available in Jupyter Notebook.
# 7) What does ~/ mean?
# The / is just a separator, but the ~ represents the home directory.
# 8) What’s the difference between an absolute path and a relative path?
# An absolute path is the full path from the root directory, while a relative path is the path dependent on the directory you are currently in.
# 9) Imagine you're in your "yourname" repo. Write the absolute and relative paths to "course_assignments/homework2".
# Absolute: /Users/hannahdavidson/python_decal_sp26/hannah/course_assignments/homework2
# Relative: ~/hannah/course_assignments/homework2
# 10) What command lets you move from "course_assignments/homework2/" to "course_assignments/"?
# cd ..
# 11) What would rm ./ do in your current directory? (Don’t try it!)
# This command deletes the current working directory.
# 12) What do the following commands do?
# git add: First step in the Saving Work cycle, this adds files to the staging area.
# git commit: This saves your new work so that you can push the changes to GitHub. This command saves work locally.
# git push: Saves work remotely (to internet, on GitHub).

# 13) What's the difference between "git add ." and "git add <file>"?
# "git add ." adds all the files in a given folder, while "git add <file>" only adds a specific file.
# 14) What do "git status" and "git log -1" do?
# "git status" gives a report of what Git sees in your repository and what the status of the files are. "git log -1" shows the most recent change.
# 15) What’s the difference between cloning a repository and pulling from it?
# Cloning allows you to obtain a copy of an existing GitHub repository. Pulling brings your local repository up to date with changes that were made on the remote repository; for instance, if a collaborator uploads a change to your code on your shared GitHub, you can pull their changes to your local repository and edit the most recent code on your own machine.
# 16) What has been your most frustrating bug or error in this class so far? How did you troubleshoot or fix it?
# The terminal in VS Code can be buggy. Simply refreshing the terminal seemed to get it to work whenever it would error out.
# 17) What’s a question you still have? What’s something you’re confused about?
# What is the purpose of the GitHub Desktop Application?
# 18) Tell me a fun fact!
# The original Costco is in San Diego, CA.
# 19) Print your favorite math expression you've learned in Python so far. 
# (Hint: Use print() and add a comment explaining what it does.)
print(5**2) # This exponentiates, so it will print the result of raising 5 to the second power.
